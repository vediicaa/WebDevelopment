    <h1>Nana Rao Park</h1>
  <p>Formerly known as Memorial Well Garden, it is the biggest park in Kanpur and is situated in the heart of the city on the Mall Road. After Independence, it has been renamed after Nana Rao Peshwa, the hero of the first War of independence in 1857. It is very beautifully laid out and has a plant nursery.</p>

  <h2>Our history</h2>
  <p>The park is of immense historical significance as the location of the massacre of around 200 British women and children, allegedly[1] on the instigation of a courtesan in Nana Sahib's court, followed by the punitive actions by British soldiers of the East India Company during the 1857 Indian rebellion.The location was originally called Memorial Well after the memorial was raised to commemorate the dead. The memorial had a large railing, a marble gothic screen with "mournful seraph" and a cross at the site of the well. The inhabitants of Cawnpore were forced to pay Â£30,000 for the creation of the memorial; this was partially their punishment for not coming to the aid of the women and children</p>
