<h2>Our History</h2>
<p>The Green Park Stadium is named after a woman named Green who used to practice horse riding here in the 1940s. It is located in the Civil Lines area in the north east part of Kanpur city near the banks of the river Ganga, which flows just behind the stadium.
It is the only stadium in India where a student gallery is available. Green Park has the largest manually operated scoreboard in the world. It also has video screens that are used during international matches.
India's first Test win over Australia in December 1959 was at the Green Park ground. This was also the first match to be played on a turf wicket here.
Since 1957 India has lost only twice at Kanpur, both times to the West Indies, in 1958 and again in 1983.
