    <p>During the reign of Queen Victoria in Britain, the park was named as Queen Victoria Garden.

King Edward ruled Britain from 1901 to 1910. In 1876, as the Prince of Wales, he had been the first British royal prince to visit India on a state visit, after the control of India passed from the East India Company to the British Crown.
