    <p>ISKCON belongs to the Gaudiya-Vaishnava sampradāya, a monotheistic tradition within the Vedic or Hindu culture. Philosophically it is based on the Sanskrit texts Bhagavad-gītā and the Bhagavat Purana, or Srimad Bhagavatam. These are the historic texts of the devotional bhakti yoga tradition, which teaches that the ultimate goal for all living beings is to reawaken their love for God, or Lord Krishna, the “all-attractive one”.</p>
    <h2>Our History</h2>
    <p>The International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) started as a spiritual movement in 1966 by Acharya A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada to spread peace, harmony and prosperity using the teachings from Vedic literature</p>
