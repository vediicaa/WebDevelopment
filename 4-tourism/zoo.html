    <h1>Kanpur Zoological Park</h1>
  <p>Kanpur Zoological Park, Kanpur is one of the oldest Zoological Park of india. It has been established and opened for the public on 4th february, 1974.
The area of the Zoological Park is about 76.56 ha. It is established in a manmade forest. The terrain of the park is undulating and resembles a high forest. It is one of those Zoological Park which have been built on modern Zoo building principles.
The animals inhabited in the Zoological Park have been put in open and moated enclosures. The moated enclosures give the animal ample space for movement and help in expressing their biological and physiological expressions. The enclosures are screened by terrain in such a way that one enclosure is not visible from the other.
Thus the animals inhabiting the enclosures do not feel undue psychological pressure of the animals of adjoining enclosures.</p>

<h2>Our history</h2>
<p>The Zoological Park in Kanpur, (earlier Cawnpore) was the brainchild of a botanist Sir Allen, a member of the British Indian Civil Service. Sir Allen wanted to open the zoo in a natural forest, but his plans were stuck in bureaucratic red-tape and did not materialize. When the zoo at last opened in 1971 by the government of independent India, it was named after him.</p>
<p>
Allen forest was developed during the British rule between the years 1913-1918 by George Berney Allen, a famous British industrialist of Kanpur on the banks of the river Ganga. The zoo was constructed from 1971-1973 under the supervision of then IFS officer RS Bhadauria. The first animal to arrive at the zoo was an otter caught by a fisherman from the Chambal River.
</p>
<p>In 1975, the first appointed doctor of the zoo was Dr. Ashwani Kumar Tripathi, who graduated from the G. B. Pant University of Agriculture and Technology, College of Veterinary & Animal Sciences. Dr. Tripathi contributed to efforts in introducing modern technology to keep the animals healthy. The enclosures for animals and birds were designed on the latest trends in the field of zoo building technology, well spread along the lake on either side of a semicircular arterial road of about 9 km. length.</p>
