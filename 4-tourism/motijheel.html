    <h1>Moti Jheel</h1>
    <p>Motijheel, the cradle of British rule in India, stands witness to a remarkable turning point in Indian history. A 350 acre oxbow lake formed out of an abandoned bed of river Bhagirathi, the Motijheel, derived its name from extensive pearl cultivation during the Nawabi period. The Jheel was famous for raising golden tinted pearls extracted from unino margaritifera species.</p>
